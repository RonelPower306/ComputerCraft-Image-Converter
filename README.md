# ComputerCraft Image Converter
## DISCLAIMER
This started as a fun project, so it may not be very "professional" like other tools.

## What is this?
This is a tool that I made to convert normal images into a list of ComputerCraft compatible images.

## Usage
This works like any ordinary python script, just type "python path\to\file\main.py" and use the following arguments:
* -i : Input image path (ex. "C:\Users\<name>\Pictures\image.png")
* -o : Output path (ex. "C:\Users\<name>\Pictures\Converted")

This program is designed to 

* -cw : Cluster Width (ex. 3)
* -ch : Cluster Height (ex. 3)

* -mw : Monitor Width (ex. 164)
* -mh : Monitor Height (ex. 81)
